<h2 id="how-to-wear">How to wear</h2>
<p>Please attach the object to the appropriate position (i.e. left or right ear, alt left or alt right ear, belly/stomach, pelvis, left or right pectorals, tongue) and then click on the &quot;edit&quot; contextual menu to move and rotate it to fine adjustment. The piercing barrel is double, if you want to show just one barrel, please rotate the object in order to hide the second barrel from view.
The name of the object, when called with through the additional script, will auto-adapt to the position where you attached it (that is, its name will become &quot;belly piercing&quot; if attached to your stomach).</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>This object is a simple piercing powered by the full set of OpenCollar scripts, with exception of the &quot;Label&quot; scripts, since the object is too small to show labels. The Titler, however works as expected.</p>
<p>We added a separate nifty script that says in open chat when the Owner pinches the wearers's piercing to give them commands. The script is trigger by touching the object, or by issuing the usual chat commands starting with &quot;/1 XX&quot; where XX are the first two letters of the wearer's username (the so called prefix), in UPPER case. The command will be also passed to the collar scripts.</p>
<p>If the Owner issues the chat command with the wearer's first two letters in lower case, our additional script will stay silent and the collar scripts will just work as usual.</p>
<p>Please notice that only a prefix consisting in the two first letters of the wearer's username will activate the additional script. If prefix has been changed in the OpenCollar settings, the additional script will not work, but the OpenCollar scripts will.</p>
<p>The choice of having an additional script instead of modifying the OpenCollar scripts allows the user to update the OpenCollar scripts without losing the additional features.</p>
<p>You can therefore update the object to the upcoming releases of the OpenCollar scripts (see <a href="https://opencollar.cc">https://opencollar.cc</a> for instructions and in-world landmarks).</p>
