<h2 id="how-to-wear">How to wear</h2>
<p>Please attach the object to the appropriate position (i.e. left or
right ear, alt left or alt right ear, belly/stomach, pelvis, left or
right pectorals, tongue) and then click on the “edit” contextual menu to
move and rotate it to fine adjustment. The piercing barrel is double, if
you want to show just one barrel, please rotate the object in order to
hide the second barrel from view. The name of the object, when called
with through the additional script, will auto-adapt to the position
where you attached it (that is, its name will become “belly piercing” if
attached to your stomach).</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>This object is a simple piercing powered by the full set of
OpenCollar scripts, with exception of the “Label” scripts, since the
object is too small to show labels. The Titler, however works as
expected.</p>
<p>We added a separate nifty script that says in open chat when the
Owner pinches the wearers’s piercing to give them commands. The script
is trigger by touching the object, or by issuing the usual chat commands
starting with “/1 XX” where XX are the first two letters of the wearer’s
username (the so called prefix), in UPPER case. The command will be also
passed to the collar scripts.</p>
<p>If the Owner issues the chat command with the wearer’s first two
letters in lower case, our additional script will stay silent and the
collar scripts will just work as usual.</p>
<p>Please notice that only a prefix consisting in the two first letters
of the wearer’s username will activate the additional script. If prefix
has been changed in the OpenCollar settings, the additional script will
not work, but the OpenCollar scripts will.</p>
<p>The choice of having an additional script instead of modifying the
OpenCollar scripts allows the user to update the OpenCollar scripts
without losing the additional features.</p>
<p>You can therefore update the object to the upcoming releases of the
OpenCollar scripts (see https://opencollar.cc for instructions and
in-world landmarks).</p>
